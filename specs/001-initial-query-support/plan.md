# Implementation Plan: Pulumi Deltastream Provider SDK (Retrospective)

**Branch**: `001-initial-query-support` | **Date**: 2025-09-07 | **Spec**: /specs/001-initial-query-support/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-initial-query-support/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (Retrospective)
All phases of the plan have been completed. Implementation, testing, and documentation are present in the codebase. Some plan artifacts (research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/) were not created as separate files; their content is reflected in code, tests, and examples.

## Summary
The Pulumi Deltastream provider is fully implemented in idiomatic Go, supporting all core Deltastream resources (Database, Namespace, Store, Object, Query) and invoke functions. CRUD and invoke operations are covered by integration tests in `examples/`. System tables are used for status checks. SDKs for Node.js and Go are generated. All requirements and edge cases from the spec are implemented.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go (latest), Node.js (SDK), Pulumi SDK, Deltastream SQL
**Primary Dependencies**: Pulumi Go SDK, Deltastream SQL interface, Go modules, Makefile/scripts
**Storage**: N/A (stateless provider, uses Deltastream backend)
**Testing**: Go integration tests in `examples/`, Pulumi test harness, no mocks
**Target Platform**: Linux server (dev), cross-platform (user)
**Project Type**: Single project (provider/ for Go code, examples/ for usage/tests)
**Performance Goals**: CRUD/invoke within Pulumi timeouts; invoke functions capped at 200 results
**Constraints**: No direct edits to generated code/schema.json; all config via Pulumi config; all SQL documented; system tables used for status
**Scale/Scope**: All Deltastream core concepts as resources/functions; SDKs for Node.js and Go; integration test coverage for all features

## Constitution Check (Retrospective)
*All requirements are met. No violations found.*

**Simplicity**:
- Single project (provider/), no unnecessary abstractions
- Direct use of Pulumi SDK and Go modules

**Architecture**:
- All features as Go libraries under provider/
- No custom CLI; Pulumi CLI used
- Documentation in README.md and code comments

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- Integration tests in `examples/` for all resources/functions
- System tables used for status checks
- No mocks; real Deltastream backend required

**Observability**:
- Structured error handling and logging in provider code

**Versioning**:
- Semantic versioning in Makefile and provider.go
- Build increments on every change

## Project Structure (Actual)

### Documentation
*No separate research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, or contracts/ directory. All documentation is in README.md, code comments, and tests.*

### Source Code
```
provider/   # Go source for provider, resources, functions
examples/   # Usage examples and integration tests (Go and Node.js)
scripts/    # Automation scripts (build, test, codegen)
Makefile    # Build/test/codegen automation
README.md   # Main documentation
```

## Phase 0: Outline & Research (Retrospective)
Research and design decisions are reflected in code, comments, and test structure. No separate research.md was created.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts (Retrospective)
Entities, validation, and contracts are defined in Go structs and Pulumi schema. Tests in `examples/` and `provider/secrets_test.go` cover contract and integration scenarios. No separate data-model.md or contracts/ directory was created.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach (Retrospective)
Tasks were executed directly as code and tests. No tasks.md was generated. All required features, tests, and edge cases from the spec are present in the codebase.

## Complexity Tracking
No constitution violations or complexity deviations. All requirements were met with a single Go project and standard Pulumi/test structure. No unnecessary abstractions or patterns were introduced.

## Progress Tracking (Retrospective)
**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete
- [x] Phase 3: Tasks generated and executed (code/tests)
- [x] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [x] Phase 5: Validation passed (integration tests)

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none)

## Lessons Learned / Notes
- Plan artifacts (research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/) are not always needed as separate files if their content is fully captured in code, tests, and documentation.
- Integration tests in `examples/` are essential for constitutional compliance and real-world validation.
- Direct mapping of spec requirements to code and tests ensures traceability and reduces documentation overhead.
