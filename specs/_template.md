 # Feature Specification: <FEATURE NAME>

**Feature Branch**: `<issue-or-short-slug>`  
**Created**: <DATE>  
**Status**: Draft | Review | Accepted | Deferred  
**Input / Source**: <link to issue / discussion / prompt>

---
## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
‚úÖ Focus on WHAT & WHY (user value)  
‚ùå Avoid HOW (implementation details, code, libraries)  
üîç Mark uncertainties with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: question]`  
üß™ Every functional requirement must be testable  
‚úÇ Remove optional sections if not relevant (do not leave "N/A")

## 1. Summary *(mandatory)*
One paragraph: problem framing + desired outcome + success signal.

## 2. Goals *(mandatory)*
Bullet list of measurable, user-centered goals.

## 3. Non-Goals *(mandatory)*
Clear exclusions to prevent scope creep.

## 4. Background & Context *(mandatory)*
Current state, constraints, related work, why now.
