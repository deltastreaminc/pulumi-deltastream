# Feature Specification: Build CI and Release GitHub Actions

**Feature Branch**: `003-build-a-ci`  
**Created**: September 7, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a CI and a Release github action which can be used to test PR and release the provider from main. It should be built in a manner that does not leak github secrets to forked repos."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a contributor to the Pulumi Deltastream provider, I want automated CI/CD workflows that ensure code quality on pull requests and facilitate reliable releases, so that I can confidently develop and deploy changes without worrying about manual testing or release processes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a contributor creates a pull request, **When** the CI workflow runs, **Then** all tests are executed and results are reported on the PR without exposing secrets.
2. **Given** a maintainer merges code to the main branch, **When** the Release workflow is triggered, **Then** all tests are executed and results are recorded against the commit.
3. **Given** a maintainer tags a revision on the main branch, **When** a new release is automatically created, packaged, and published to the appropriate distribution channels.
3. **Given** a fork submits a pull request, **When** the CI workflow runs, **Then** tests do not run automatically but can be triggered by repo members.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when tests fail during a CI run?
	- The pull request status shows failure. The contributor can fix the issues and submit a new commit or PR update to rerun the tests.
- How does the system handle version conflicts during release?
	- The release version is based on the git tag of the commit being released, ensuring no version conflicts.
- What happens if a release workflow is interrupted or fails midway?
	- It is the responsibility of the repository owner or members to retrigger the workflow manually.
- How are secrets managed when a PR comes from a fork?
	- Tests that require secrets only run if explicitly triggered by a repository member; otherwise, they are skipped for forked PRs.
- How is version management handled for automated releases?
	- The release version is determined by the git tag associated with the commit being released.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement a CI workflow that runs on all pull requests to verify code quality and functionality.
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement a Release workflow that creates and publishes new releases of the provider.
- **FR-003**: CI workflow MUST prevent exposure of repository secrets to forked repositories.
- **FR-004**: CI workflow MUST run unit tests, integration tests, and code quality checks.
- **FR-005**: CI workflow MUST report test results back to the pull request.
**FR-006**: Release workflow MUST generate appropriate artifacts for all supported platforms: linux x86_64, linux arm64, and darwin arm64.
**FR-007**: Release workflow MUST handle versioning according to semantic versioning principles.
**FR-008**: Release workflow MUST publish npm packages to @deltastream/pulumi-deltastream and create a git tag for Go releases (no additional publishing required for Go).
- **FR-009**: Both workflows MUST follow GitHub Actions security best practices to protect sensitive information.
	- For npm: Published to @deltastream/pulumi-deltastream
	- For Go: Git tag created, no external publishing
	- Platforms: linux x86_64, linux arm64, darwin arm64
- **GitHub Workflow**: Definition of automated processes that run on GitHub events (PR creation, merge to main, etc.)
- **GitHub Secret**: Sensitive information stored securely in the repository settings, used by workflows.
- **Release Artifact**: Built packages, binaries, or other files that are published as part of a release.
