# Pulumi DeltaStream Agent Guidelines


## Workflow
- Follow constitutional principles from `/memory/constitution.md`
- All requirements in `/specs/{feature}` directory
- Implementation plans must pass Constitution Check before proceeding
- **IMPORTANT:** Anytime `/memory/constitution.md` is changed, you MUST use the checklist in `@memory/constitution_update_checklist.md` to update all dependent documents and templates for consistency.
